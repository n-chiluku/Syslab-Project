"Hello," Andrew said.
"How are you?" Neil asked.
"I'm fine," said Andrew.
"Well, I'm tired," Neil sighed.
They walked inside the building.
"Why are you tired?" Andrew asked.
"Just work," shrugged Neil.
"Me too," Andrew agreed.
"I hope we get a break sometime soon," Neil leaned back against the wall.
"Likewise," said Andrew.
"Do you need to get back to work?" Neil asked with a sigh.
"Unfortunately, yes," Andrew replied, equally dispirited.
"Maybe we can meet again next week?" Neil suggested.
"That sounds good," Andrew confirmed with a nod.
They parted ways for the evening.
