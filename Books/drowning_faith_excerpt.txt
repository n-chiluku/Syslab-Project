Yin Jinzha is dead, and the House of Yin mourns.
Vaisra is alone in the great hall when Nezha's permitted in. The Lady Saikhara is not present. Confined to her rooms, they say. They say she’s gone mad, catatonic, unable to say anything but the name of her favorite son.
She hasn’t asked for Nezha. When Mingzha died, she did not so much as look in his direction for up to a year. Nezha’s mother loves him, but it’s a strained, wretched love, one stained by the ever-lingering suspicion that the person who came back from the grotto was not really her son.
Vaisra sits stooped atop his throne, hunched over, shoulders still bent from the injuries he sustained at Lusan. He looks aged twenty years by grief.
Nezha wants to rush to his father, to throw his hands around his shoulder. But habit, and propriety, keep them apart.
"I'm sorry," he says. "I know it should have been me."
Vaisra doesn't hesitate. "It should have been you."
A great silence stretches between them.
"How is Mother?" Nezha asks.
"She's with Sister Petra," Vaisra says. "She finds more comfort from her...priests."
Nezha dares to ask. "Is that prudent?"
"It doesn't matter. Let her seek solace where she can find it, the poor woman. Three sons she gave me." Vaisra sighs. "Three."
What goes unsaid: that only one remains.
What also goes unsaid: the wrong one.
"I'll kill her," Nezha vows. He doesn't have to feign his vehemence. He hates Su Daji, hates her for what she’s done to this country, to his family. Never has he been so convinced of the righteousness of their cause. "I'll destroy the Empress for what she did to us. I'll deliver you her head, Father, I promise-"
"Don't." Vaisra only shakes his head. "You don't have the strength."
